# OWASP Project MLSec Top 10 - Working Group Charter

## Purpose

The primary aim of of the OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10 project
is to deliver an overview of the top 10 security issues of machine learning systems.
As such, a major goal of this project is to develop
a high quality deliverable, reviewed by industry peers.

## Target Audience

The primary audience for the deliverables in this project are developers,
machine learning engineering and operational practitioners, and
application security experts. While each of these roles
build, operate and secure machine learning systems, the content is not
aimed to be exclusively at them. The content will aim to specify where
appropriate the level of understanding required for specific technology
domains.

## Scope

The project will provide an overview of the top 10 security issues of machine
learning sytems. Due to the rapid adoption
of machine learning systems, there are related projects within
OWASP and other organisations, that may have narrower or broader
scope than this project. As an example, while adversarial attacks
is a category of threats, this project will also cover
non-adversarial scenarios, such as security hygiene of
machine learning operational and engineering workflows.
