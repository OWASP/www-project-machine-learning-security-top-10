# Is this document what you need?

This work overlaps with other projects run by the OWASP Foundation and also with work done by other organisations. It may not be suitable for your needs, especially if:
- you are looking for a security reference for Large Language Models (then check out the OWASP Top10 for LLM [here](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/)) 
- You are working with areas such as ethics of AI, sustainability of AI, etc. 
- you are looking for a risk assessment framework or a complete threat model for AI/ML systems (then check e.g. [AI RMF by NIST](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/AI_RMF))
- you are looking for real vulnerabilities in AI/ML systems (check our [RELATED](RELATED.md) document for more details) 

Of course, this document may be helpful to you, but if you are looking for something to help you solve the above task, it is worth looking at these documents.
