## Description

Data poisoning attacks occur when an attacker manipulates the training data to
cause the model to behave in an undesirable way.

## How to Prevent

**Data validation and verification:** Ensure that the training data is
thoroughly validated and verified before it is used to train the model. This can
be done by implementing data validation checks and employing multiple data
labelers to validate the accuracy of the data labeling.

**Secure data storage:** Store the training data in a secure manner, such as
using encryption, secure data transfer protocols, and firewalls.

**Data separation:** Separate the training data from the production data to
reduce the risk of compromising the training data.

**Access control:** Implement access controls to limit who can access the
training data and when they can access it.

**Monitoring and auditing:** Regularly monitor the training data for any
anomalies and conduct audits to detect any data tampering.

**Model validation:** Validate the model using a separate validation set that
has not been used during training. This can help to detect any data poisoning
attacks that may have affected the training data.

**Model ensembles:** Train multiple models using different subsets of the
training data and use an ensemble of these models to make predictions. This can
reduce the impact of data poisoning attacks as the attacker would need to
compromise multiple models to achieve their goals.

**Anomaly detection:** Use anomaly detection techniques to detect any abnormal
behavior in the training data, such as sudden changes in the data distribution
or data labeling. These techniques can be used to detect data poisoning attacks
early on.

It is important to note that this chart is only a sample based on
[the scenario below](#scenario1) only. The actual risk assessment will depend on
the specific circumstances of each machine learning system.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario \#1: Training a spam classifier {#scenario1}

An attacker poisons the training data for a deep learning model that classifies
emails as spam or not spam. The attacker executed this attack by injecting the
maliciously labeled spam emails into the training data set. This could be done
by compromising the data storage system, for example by hacking into the network
or exploiting a vulnerability in the data storage software. The attacker could
also manipulate the data labeling process, such as by falsifying the labeling of
the emails or by bribing the data labelers to provide incorrect labels.

### Scenario \#2: Training a network traffic classification system

An attacker poisons the training data for a deep learning model that is used to
classify network traffic into different categories, such as email, web browsing,
and video streaming. They introduce a large number of examples of network
traffic that are incorrectly labeled as a different type of traffic, causing the
model to be trained to classify this traffic as the incorrect category. As a
result, the model may be trained to make incorrect traffic classifications when
the model is deployed, potentially leading to misallocation of network resources
or degradation of network performance.
