Hi @axsaucedo I hope the above comment makes sense. I would love for you to contribute to this given your familiarity and ownership of the https://ethical.institute content.

I see this potentially taking a bit of time as there is a large amount of content at your site to potentially look at merging.

This could also be an opportunity to look at the current Top 10 list categories in this project to see if they need amending.
