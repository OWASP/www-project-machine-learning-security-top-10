### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

For example in Top10 for LLM there's this page with a summary of each of the vulnerabilities, which I think would be pretty useful to have in Top10 for ML as well. 

Sometimes  when you e.g. work on some slides for a presentation, you just want to get a short summary of each of the vulnerabilities. In my opinion including such a page in Top10 for ML would be an improvement:
